'''
boot.py This is the first script that runs on your module when it

turns on. This is often used to connect a module to a WiFi network so that

Telnet and FTP can be used without connecting to the WiFi AP created by the

module and not cluttering up the main.py file. As a beginner you do not

need to use a boot.py'''
